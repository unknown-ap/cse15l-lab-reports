Keys pressed: `ssh cs15lwi23aok@ieng6.ucsd.edu` `<enter>`  
I just typed out `ssh cs15lwi23aok@ieng6.ucsd.edu` then pressed enter to log in  

**Step 5: Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account**

Keys pressed: `git clone` `<^V>` `<enter>`  
I typed out git clone and then pressed control V in order to paste the link I had already copied.  
  
**Step 6: Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail**

Keys pressed: `cd la` `<tab>` `<enter>` `<^C>` `<^V>` `<enter>` `<^C>` `<^V>` `List` `<tab>` `T` `<tab>` `<enter>`  
I used tab to finish changing my directory faster and then I copied the commands from the class website in order to run the JUnit tests faster. I also had to type out the name of the test file by typing out List then pressing tab to autocomplete and add T so it would run the tester and not the regular file.  
  
**Step 7: Edit the code file to fix the failing test**

Keys pressed: `nano Li` `<tab>` `.java` `<down>` `<right>` `<delete>` `1` `<^O>` `<enter>` `<^X>` `<Y>`  
I used nano and tab to autocomplete the word and held the down and right key until I could fix the file and change it to `index2` instead of `index1`. Then I just used the commands at the bottom to save and exit.  
  
**Step 8: Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed**

Keys pressed: `<up>` `<up>` `<up>` `<up>` `<enter>` `<up>` `<up>` `<up>` `<up>` `<enter>`  
I just pressed up four times because the compile command was saved in my history then did it another four times to run the tests.  
  
**Step 9: Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account (you can pick any commit message!)**

Keys pressed: `git commit` `Li` `<tab>` `-m "changes"` `<enter>` `git push`  
I typed out `git commit` and only `Li` after so the tab would autocomplete it and them added my own message. After that I pushed the change to my Github account.
