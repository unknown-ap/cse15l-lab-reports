1. Step one of logging into the remote server is to make sure that you have/know your password for your account. If you don't know your password, you can reset it here: [Password Reset](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)
2. Next, don't forget to install VS Code if your computer doesn't already have the application. You can install it here: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Once you open it up it should look something like this.

3. Now open the terminal on your Mac and type in `$ ssh cs15lwi23xxx@ieng6.ucsd.edu`, except the xxx is your own account info. If this is your first time logging in, your computer may ask if you wish to continue. Type in "yes". After typing this in, you will have to type in the password you have in step 1. After logging in, it should look something like this.

4. Now, you can try running some commands remotely. Try using `cd` or `pwd`. Here's an example after running `ls -lat`, which lists out all of the files and their dates.
